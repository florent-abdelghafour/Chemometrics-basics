# DEMO KERNEL PROCESSING

GOAL = Process Hyperspecral imaging to extrcat chemometrics ready data -> Build chemometrics model


*Load HSI data: Full, bands, pixels, slices, random samples

*Correct images in Reflectance

* Perform PCA and observe data distribution

* Segments objects and sort kernels

* Perform PLS-DA
